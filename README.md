# CNA Quality Model Validation Survey Results

This repository contains the data and a report based on the analysis of the data of a survey conducted between October and December 2022. The aim was to validate a previously formulated [quality model for cloud-native application architectures](https://r0light.github.io/cna-quality-model/).

The data is published here so that the analysis and interpretation of the results could be reproduced or refined.

The analysis was done using [R](https://www.r-project.org/), and specifially [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/), so to reproduce the analysis, you can import the project in R studio and re-run the script for generating the report using the included [knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/) functionality.
